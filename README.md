# DSA-2-Project-
The Routing project in C uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on a custom map, considering road factors. 

# Mini Project: Routing

## Purpose ---
   The shortest path on a unique map was traversed using an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C with updated weights that took unpredictable events into account.


## Weightage calculations
--- ### Dataset Made Available:

     1. Nodes (intersections)
     2. Highway (edges)
     3. The distance travelled.
     4. Traffic Flow/Density
     5. Wedding Season: Function halls are seen to be present. 
     6. Limits on speed

### User Input: To determine the fastest route
     Begin(vertex ID - integer)
     2. (Vertex ID - integer)
     
    to determine an edge's weight
     Begin(vertex ID - integer)
     2. (Vertex ID - integer)
     3. Time (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
     
    lend a fresh edge
     Begin(vertex ID - integer)
     2. (Vertex ID - integer)
     3. Road length (km + float)
     4. Speed restriction (inches per kilometre)
     5. Car count or traffic density
     
     To delete an edge
     1. Start(vertex ID -integer)
     2. Destination(vertex ID -integer)

### Graphinput Text File format:

- The first line contains an integer |V| denoting the number of intersection(nodes). The ID of each intersection is between 0 and |V| - 1.
- The next line contains |V| space seperated integers denoting the number of function halls at each node (0 in case there are none).
- The next line contains an integer |E| denoting the number of roads(edges). 
- The next |E| lines contains the following data for each edge:
   - The first line of each set contains 2 space seperated integers denoting the start and end vertices of the road.
   - The next line contains 3 space seperated values denoting the length (in kilometers), the speed limit (in kmph) and the traffic density (number of cars per kilometer) of the given road.

### visuual representation of graph
By utilizing Tkinter's canvas widget, you can draw various shapes, lines, and curves to represent data points, and then use different colors, sizes, and labels to enhance the visual representation. This enables you to create graphs.
